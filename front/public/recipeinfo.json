A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food.

Form the dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in the raw sugar. Place the balls at least 2 inches apart on the cookie sheet and flatten slightly with your fingers or  the bottom of a glass. I put 8 cookies on a sheet.Set the prepped cookie sheets in the freezer (or if you live in a frigid climate like me, outside) for about 5 minutes or until the cookies are nice and firm. Bake at 300 F. for about 12 - 14 minutes or just until they get just very lightly brown on the edges.
